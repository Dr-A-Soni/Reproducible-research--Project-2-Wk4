Reproducible Research Week 4 Assignment

Synopsis:

The assignment is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database
and it covers the Storms and other severe weather events that can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities, with data apaning from 1950 to November 2011.

This project address the following questions with relevant answer and supoorted evidence in terms of plots:
1)Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE\color{red}{\verb|EVTYPE|}
EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2) Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

Goal:
the Goal of this addignment is to :
1) to learn to generate RMarkdown document
2) to know the importance of reproducibility
3) to analyse the data and produce answers for the given questions.
